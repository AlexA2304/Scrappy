# Vision Statement
Transforming Agile Development, One Sprint at a Time! Scrappy is your go-to Web App suite designed to make Scrum and Agile process as seamless as possible. We prioritize what you need, offering robust features like intuitive User Stories Management, Sprint Planning, and Real-time Burndown Charts. With Scrappy, never lose sight of your project’s pace and always stay in sync with your team. Dive into a new age of streamlined, collaborative, and efficient Agile workflows. Now you’re not just Agile, you’re Scrappy!

# Motivation
Working on a team to build software can be difficult. With remote team members and multiple streams of communication, keeping everything in one simple application has proven difficult. This application helps collate all the data for scrum/agile meetings, making product coordination simple and effective. Also, we want a good grade ;)

# Risks to project completion
* new language or working environment
* no prior experience working with these team members
* lack of some needed resources
* Staying on track, in line with the process outlined by the class
* Teammate availability and having enough time
* Framing out the app in a way that makes sense
* Understanding the implications of certain decisions
* Creating too much tech debt/backlog

# Mitigation Strategies
* Frequent meetings, as needed and weekly
* Use slack for real time communications, communication is critical
* Use teammates strengths and experiences where they're needed (database/FE)
* Keep time available during the week
* Follow the processes we are taught in the course
* Pair programming and code reviews
* Keep complexity to a minimum

# Development Method
We choose SCRUM!
